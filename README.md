# Football Player Data

Football Player Data is an application designed to scrape FBREF profiles of footballers to determine their strengths and weaknesses.
This is currently a work in progress.

# Installation

The only way to currently run this application is to clone the repository.

# Usage

Once the repository is cloned, run 'python main.py' and you should see the data for footballers who are 18 years old or younger, and have played over 450 minutes in Europe's top 5 leagues in the last 12 months (Top 5 leagues are English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga and French Ligue 1 at the time of writing)
